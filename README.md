About the study

Post-viral conditions (PVS) such as post-COVID syndrome are characterized by heterogeneous and nonspecific symptoms that can fluctuate over time, leading to significant diagnostic uncertainty for both patients and healthcare providers. Expressing this uncertainty may diminish patient trust and satisfaction, as individuals often feel dismissed and left alone by their doctors. This study aims to evaluate the impact of communicating diagnostic uncertainty on patient trust and satisfaction among hypothetical patients with PVS. In an experimental online study (N = 417) conducted in September 2024, participants read a vignette describing a previous viral infection followed by persistent debilitating symptoms prompting them to consult their GP. The study employed a 1x4 between-subject design in which diagnostic certainty was manipulated. Participants were informed either that their symptoms were certainly due to the prior infection or that they might be related but the nonspecific symptoms did not allow for a certain diagnosis. Two exploratory conditions supplemented this uncertainty communication with either a normalisation of uncertainty or a hopeful outlook.
